Lasiurus_borealis,"The maximum lifespan of Lasiurus borealis, also known as the eastern red bat, is not precisely known and varies greatly depending on various factors such as environmental conditions, food availability, and exposure to threats. However, several studies and estimates have provided insights into their potential longevity:

* **10 to 15 years:** This is a commonly cited estimate of the maximum lifespan of eastern red bats in the wild, as reported by the Illinois Natural History Survey (2019). It suggests that most individuals may live for a decade or more.
* **16 years:** A study by Kunz and Reynolds (2003) documented a recaptured eastern red bat that was estimated to be 16 years old, indicating that they can potentially exceed the typical lifespan estimate.
* **17 years:** This is the maximum known lifespan recorded for a captive eastern red bat, as reported by the Animal Diversity Web (2023). However, it's important to note that captive animals often have different lifespans compared to wild populations.

It's worth noting that these lifespan estimates may vary depending on the specific population and geographical location, as environmental factors and prey availability can influence their survival rates.

Peromyscus_nasutus,"The maximum lifespan of Peromyscus nasutus is estimated to be **28 months** for males and **33 months** for females in the wild. This is based on data from a capture-mark-recapture study conducted in Central and South America, which found that the average lifespan of Peromyscus nasutus was 6-8 months in both males and females. However, some individuals were found to live for up to 28 months for males and 33 months for females.
